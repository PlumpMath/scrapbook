      <h1>Part 1: Introduction &amp; Overview</h1>
      <p class="orange">SSH is a protocol that is used over the internet. It creates a secure 
        encrypted connection between two computers. It also allows you to create 
        things called tunnels which can send all sorts of other computer applications 
        over the internet â€” encrypted to prevent anyone from intercepting it. 
        Examples: remote desktop, email, web browsing, file transfer, remote printing. 
      </p>
	  <p><b>This document has an inherent tendency to get overly complicated. I am trying to keep things simple 
	  and apologise for any confusion. Please <a href="http://quarkphysics.ca/contact.htm">email&nbsp;me</a> 
	  if you find any errors or unclear explanations.</b></p>
	  <p>While I explain how to do a lot of things with SSH, I am not sure if I am an expert. The problem is that there
	  is no document clearly explaining how to do all of this. A lot of it, especially ssh -R, had to be discovered through
	  trial and error, and by getting nuggets of information from many other sites. The title of this article is technically false, since <font color="#cc0000">I am not covering a few things like
	  ssh-agent forwarding, file copying using ssh, scp or sftp, using ssh-copy-id, sshfs, or ssh-vulnkey.</font> 
	  I don't use these things regularly and they are not essential to ssh connections and tunneling which is what
	  I am focusing more on.</p>
      <p>Note: there are two versions of SSH, make sure that you always 
        use version 2, version 1 can be hacked.</p>

      <h2><a name="soft">I. </a>Software referred to:</h2>
      <p><font color="#0000CC"><strong>Windows XP</strong></font> - this is the 
        operating system on my laptop, desktop, and office computers.</p>
      <p><strong><font color="#0000CC">Ubuntu</font></strong> - the operating 
        system on my Linux server. Very easy to setup .</p>
      <p>There are a number of programs downloaded and added to it. These will 
        be described as they show up below.</p>
      <h3>Free windows programs:</h3>
      <p> (1) <font color="#0000CC"><strong>Putty</strong></font> (and Pagent). 
        This is the standard <strong>ssh </strong>program for Windows. It has 
        a handy commandline version, but unfortunately some commands are missing 
        (the GUI interface does more than the CLI) !<br>
        <br>
        The <strong>Putty Portable</strong> version is nice because you can create one 
		setup exactly as you like it and trasnfer it to your laptop, USB drive, etc. 
		The problem with this is that PuttyPortable only allows one instance of the program at a time.
		This means that you can't set up one tunnel and then run putty to tunnel something
		through the first tunnel. What I've done is setup Putty exactly how I want it on one computer, 
		then exported the registry entries for Putty. On my other computers, etc. first I delete 
		all previous Putty registry entries, then merge the ones from my ideal setup. 
		See <a href="http://the.earth.li/%7Esgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-file">"Configuring PuTTY"</a>
	  </p>
      <p>(2) <font color="#0000CC"><strong>SSH Secure Shell Client 3.2.9</strong></font> 
        This is a program that is no longer supported. However it still works 
        well for everything except for SOCKS proxies. The one wonderful feature 
        that this program has is that SSH FTP is built in and is graphical!! You 
        just point and click to transfer files using SSH. (This can also be done 
        by downloading Filezilla and configuring that, but it is one more program 
        to install.)</p>
      <p>(3) <strong><font color="#0000CC">WGET</font></strong> or <strong><font color="#0000CC">CURL</font></strong>- 
        a commandline utility to get a webpage and save it as a textfile. This 
        program also works in Linux.</p>
      <p>(4) <strong><font color="#0000CC">AutoIt</font></strong>- this is the 
        scripting program that I use instead of batch files. It is much more powerful 
        than batch files. It is also better than Kixtart which I was using before. 
      </p>
      <p>(5) <strong><font color="#0000CC">TightVNC</font></strong> This is one of the common VNC programs. Use any of them 
	  to view and control your computer remotely. Unfortunately TightVNC Portable is not free! How dumb.</p>
      <p>(6) <strong><font color="#0000CC">Filezilla</font></strong> If you don't use "SSH Secure Shell" 
        for ftp transfers then you should probably use this. It is a GUI ftp program 
        that can be tunneled though SSH.</p>
	  <p><strong>Cygwin</strong>. This is a unix shell for windows. I tried using 
        it for SSH, but ran into snags having SSH and SSH-AGENT stay running when 
        I closed the shell. I also couldn't get them to restart SSH automatically 
        when the internet connection is reset. Cygwin is used if you want to run 
        an SSHD ssh-daemon in Windows.</p>      
      <p>The programs SRVANY and LAUNCHSRV were used to try and launch Putty as 
        a service, but it never worked properly.</p>

      <h2>II. Network Setup</h2>
      <p>The following diagram explains my home/office network. I will be referring to these computers by their names and IP addresses as I explain how to use SSH in various ways.</p>
      <p><img src="networkl.png" alt="" align="absbottom" border="1" height="537" width="622"></p>
	  <ul>
        <li>At the bottom right is my home. I need to access my home files from 
          anywhere I go. </li>
        <li>At the top left is my office. I need to be able to access my office 
          computers from anywhere, and print from anywhere.</li>
        <li> I have a unix account on a computer named Astro (this computer becomes 
          very important for security reasons)</li>
        <li>I also want to use my laptop securely at a hotel, etc. So I will route 
          all my internet access through my home computers.</li>        
        <li><u>All connections must be encrypted (using ssh).</u> The only connection 
          that is not encrypted is the outgoing one from my ASDL modem (and then 
          my ISP) to the rest of the internet (e.g. to Google.com)</li>
        <li>I don't want the rest of the internet to be able to access my home 
          computers</li>
        <li>I don't want the rest of the internet to get at my office computers 
          through the hole that I (surreptitiously) punch in my workplace's firewall.</li>
        <li><img src="bluestar.gif" alt="" height="20" width="20"> My ISP assigns me 
          a <strong><font color="#000099">dynamic address</font></strong>. Therefore 
          it can change any time the link goes down. To deal with this, you need 
          to have a webpage which you can update with scripts (more later). I 
          assume that you have a webpage somewhere outside of your local home 
          network that you can control and modify. I am writing these instructions 
          to handle dynamic IP addresses. <br>
          If you have a <strong>static IP</strong> address for your home, you 
          can simplify these instructions a lot (ignore all of the <img src="bluestar.gif" alt="" height="20" width="20"> 
          sections).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><em><font color="#990000"><img src="redstar.gif" height="20" width="20"> 
        Update: </font></em> I no longer have access to Astro! The university 
        I was using finally cut me off.</strong> I will now modify these instructions 
        so that they work without having access to a unix account on a computer 
        like Astro. (Astro was important for hosting my webpage as well as doing 
        SSH tunnelling.) <br>
        Anything specific to Astro will be marked with a <img src="redstar.gif" alt="" height="20" width="20"> 
        â€” mostly in <a href="http://www.quarkphysics.ca/ssh/ssh_everything5.htm">part 5</a>. Instead, I now am using a website 
        that allows me to write Perl CGI scripts.</p>

        computer they are tunneled to. This will become more clear later on. There 
        are so many different things that I want to do, that it is important to 
        organize them in a table. Each<strong> table</strong> 
        is a seperate Putty profile. It looks really complicated, but it is used to configure Putty 
		and/or write out ssh scripts, which I have added under each table. I'm not sure how to make this simpler or clearer. Don't let this confusion make you give up!</p>

      <h2><a name="ssh_not">VI. One thing that SSH cannot do</a></h2>
      <p>SSH cannot overcome the problems of Microsoft Windows in one area: sharing 
        network drives over SSH tunnels. Why is this needed anyway? You can easily 
		transfer files using SSH (and sftp). The reason for doing this would be to stream
		a file from your Windows desktop at home to your laptop when you're in a hotel
		- e.g. to listen to an MP3 song or start watching a video without having to download it 
		from your desktop first.<br>
		There is a way to do it in MS Windows 
        - you have to disable file and printer sharing, add a loopback device, 
        tunnel port 139 ... The problem that I have with doing this is that it 
        messes up my other network connections (e.g. my corporate email program 
        won't work at all if I do this). I think that this problem occurs because 
        Windows does not consider the possibility that you might be sharing drives 
        remotely. </p>
      <p>The solution is to set up a VPN - Virtual Private Network.<br>
        Is it worth the trouble? Probably not. You can do so much with SSH that 
        you probably don't need a VPN. The main reason for needing a VPN is if 
        you need to access files from a number of servers - e.g. at the office. 
        This allows you to connect to the office network just as if you are physically 
        at the office. You can do this with SSH, but you would need a separate 
        tunnel for each machine you want to connect to as well as something (sshd 
        or VNC) each machine to accept the connection.</p>
