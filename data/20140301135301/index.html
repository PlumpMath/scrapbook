<div class="entry-content"><h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Anyone who’s ever dabbled in the dark art that is Emacs knows that
chances are you’ll be overwhelmed before you start making sense of
Emacs’ unique view of the world. There is just too much information
out there…</p>

<p>There are many great Emacs resources targeting different
groups of Emacs users. The problems is that often the people that would
benefit the most from some of those resources don’t even know about
their existence. That’s why I’m putting together this article – to collect the
best resources in a single location and categorize them
accordingly. Surely I’ll miss a lot of stuff – I’m just one man and I
certainly don’t know about many great repositories of Emacs wisdom. I
hope you’ll help me by pointing out such repositories in the comments
section. So here we go…</p>

<h2>Emacs Squires (Beginners)</h2>

<h4>The Emacs Tutorial</h4>

<p>Built into Emacs itself this should be the first thing you ever read
about Emacs. The tutorial is interactive (you get to play with
concepts after you read about them) and you can start it at any point
(provided you’ve started Emacs first) by
pressing <code>C-h t</code>.</p>

<h4>The Emacs Refcard</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/ess11/resources/emacs-refcard.pdf">The Emacs Refcard</a>
is a very useful resource to keep tugged under your keyboard (in
printed form). It’s generally bundled with your Emacs installation in
both pdf and tex formats, but I’ve included a hyperlink to spare you
the search for it.</p>

<h4>The Emacs Reference Mug</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/geekcheat.13042487">The Emacs Reference Mug</a>
is basically a refcard printed on a tea mug. Let’s you memorize
keybindings while enjoying a delightful cup of English Breakfast…</p>

<h4>Mastering Emacs</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.masteringemacs.org/">Mastering Emacs</a> is a relatively new
web site (it just celebrated it’s first birthday), dedicated to
teaching Emacs to beginners. It has some really nice articles to get
you started and a nice
<a href="http://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide/">reading guide</a> to go
alongside them. Mastering Emacs features a few articles, covering more
advanced topics as well.</p>

<h4>Emacs Fu</h4>

<p><a href="http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/">Emacs Fu</a> is a blog discussing little
(and not so little) tweaks to make working with Emacs even nicer. Its
author has been an Emacs user for the last decade or so and certainly
has a lot of interesting tips and tricks to share from you. Even I
happen to learn something new from Emacs Fu from time to time.</p>

<h4>Meet Emacs</h4>

<p><a href="http://peepcode.com/products/meet-emacs">Meet Emacs</a> is a great
introductory Emacs screencast by <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>. It’s
not free, but if you prefer screencasts over reading manuals you
should definitely have a look at it.</p>

<h4>Programothesis</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/emailataskcom">Programothesis</a> is an
YouTube channel dedicated to Emacs. It features over 30 short Emacs
screencasts covering various topics.</p>

<h4>Learning Emacs</h4>

<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006488.do">Learning GNU Emacs</a>
is the last book that was ever published about Emacs. It’s a bit dated
now (the last edition is from 2004), but Emacs doesn’t change that fast
and you’ll still find a lot of relevant info into the book. This was
the second resource I’ve read about Emacs (after the built-in
tutorial) and while I didn’t find the book outstanding I did find it
very helpful.</p>

<h4>Emacs Rookie</h4>

<p><a href="http://emacsrookie.com/">Emacs Rookie</a> is a web site dedicated to
Emacs tips (mostly about beginners). There are only a few articles
there right now, but hopefully their number will grow substantially
over time.</p>

<h4>Emacs Rocks</h4>

<p><a href="http://emacsrocks.com/">Emacs Rocks</a> is a series of short Emacs
screencasts. While some of the things suggested there make me grind my
teeth, there are also quite a bit valuable suggestions that you’ll find
in the short videos.</p>

<h4>Emacs Prelude</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> is a custom
Emacs 24 configuration developed by me and optimized for your joy and
productivity. It’s a good starting point for anyone looking to get
started with Emacs without too much initial research and ceremony. I’m
always looking for ideas on extending and improving Prelude.</p>

<h4>Emacs Starter Kit</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>
is a custom Emacs configuration similar to Prelude. The stable version
targets Emacs 23 and ESK 2.0 targets Emacs 24 and makes heavy use of the
new Emacs Lisp Package Manager (ELPA) introduced there. I’m obviously
much more fond of Prelude, but it’s only fair that I mention the
competition as well (ESK has been around much longer and is a more
stable project by all means).</p>

<h4>An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</h4>

<p>Although Emacs Lisp is usually thought of in association only with
Emacs, it is a full computer programming language.  You can use Emacs
Lisp as you would any other programming language.</p>

<p>Perhaps you want to understand programming; perhaps you want to
extend Emacs; or perhaps you want to become a programmer.  This
introduction to Emacs Lisp is designed to get you started: to guide you
in learning the fundamentals of programming, and more importantly, to
show you how you can teach yourself to go further.</p>

<p>It’s also built into Emacs – you can access it by typing <code>C-h i m
Emacs Lisp Intro</code>. The book is very light reading and doesn’t assume
any programming experience. If you’re an experienced software engineer
the <em>Emacs Lisp Manual</em> might be a better place to start you Emacs
Lisp adventure.</p>

<h4>On Twitter</h4>

<p>There are a few Twitter accounts dedicated on Emacs. I recommend you
to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/emacs_knight">@emacs_knight</a>(operated
by yours truly), <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/learnemacs">@learnemacs</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/EmacsRocks">@EmacsRocks</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/dotemacs">@dotemacs</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/dotemax">@dotemax</a>. My personal account is
listed in the sidebar – while I do tweet about Emacs there from time
to time, I mostly tweet about programming so follow me at your own
discretion.</p>

<h4>On IRC</h4>

<p>There is a irc.freenode.org channel named #emacs. I highly recommend
you to hang around there – a lot of great Emacs hackers are permanent
residents of the channel and will kindly answer most questions you
might have about Emacs.</p>

<p>Given that Emacs has a great IRC mode built-in (that would ERC) you
have little excuse not be in #emacs. My handle there is <em>bozhidar</em> (I
know – total surprise, right?).</p>

<h2>Emacs Knights</h2>

<h4>Effective Emacs</h4>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs">Effective Emacs</a>
is a popular post by Steve Yegge in which he discusses a few
techniques to make more effective use of Emacs. I don’t fully endorse
them, but still there a few great tips in there.</p>

<h4>A Gentle Introduction to CEDET</h4>

<p>If you’re doing any C/C++ programming you owe it to yourself to read
Alex Ott’s excellent article
<a href="http://alexott.net/en/writings/emacs-devenv/EmacsCedet.html">A Gentle Introduction to CEDET</a>.</p>

<h4>Emacs Wiki</h4>

<p><a href="http://emacswiki.org/">The Emacs Wiki</a> is the one stop to find answers
about all topics related to Emacs. The Wiki, however, is poorly
moderated and in a state of total chaos and disarray. This makes it a
bit hard to sift through all the crap there and extract only the
really valuable bits of information. The amount of wisdom collected on
the wiki is impressive never-the-less and every experienced Emacs
user should browse it numerous categories for tips and tricks.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprising for some – the Emacs Wiki is housing a huge
collection of Emacs Lisp source files as well. I have a personal
appeal to all the people using the wiki to house their Emacs Lisp
projects – “For the love of God – use <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>!”.</p>

<h4>The Emacs Manual</h4>

<p>The official Emacs Manual is one of the greatest Emacs resources ever
written, but only a handful of Emacs users seems to have read it. It’s
built into Emacs itself and you can start perusing it simply by typing
<code>C-h r</code>. While it’s a hefty volume, the Emacs Manual has one serious
advantage over the competition – it’s always up-to-date.</p>

<h4>The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</h4>

<p>If you’re serious about extending Emacs – this is the book to
read. It’s targeting experience developers, it’s always up-to-date and
it’s the ultimate Emacs Lisp resource in the world. It’s also
available for reading directly from Emacs itself – <code>C-h i m Emacs Lisp</code>.</p>

<h4>Planet Emacsen</h4>

<p><a href="http://planet.emacsen.org/">Planet Emacsen</a> is a RSS feed aggregating most well-known Emacs blogs out there
(including this one). If
you’re serious about Emacs you have to subscribe to it.</p>

<p>Mentioning it also spares me the need to list all those great blogs in
here.</p>

<h2>Emacs Masters</h2>

<h4>Understanding SLIME</h4>

<p><a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/081209.html">Understanding SLIME</a> is an
excellent overview of SLIME, featuring a myriad of links to great
SLIME resources. You should see the SLIME video tutorial even if you
don’t read anything else from the article.</p>

<h4>SLIME Tips</h4>

<p><a href="http://slime-tips.tumblr.com/">SLIME Tips</a> is a blog dedicated to
sharing little know features of SLIME with the rest of us. Seems to be
dormant, but started off pretty nice…</p>

<h4>Practical Common Lisp</h4>

<p>Common Lisp? We’re talking about Emacs, right? Strange or not I found
more about Emacs Lisp, while studying <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>, than
the bundled Emacs Lisp manuals. For me the explanation is simply –
Practical Common Lisp helped me get the Lisp way of thinking. There is
also the <code>cl</code> module is Emacs that implements a good deal of Common
Lisp in Emacs Lisp and I use it all the time. I, personally, dream of
an Emacs using Common Lisp (or at least Scheme) instead of Emacs Lisp,
but doubt I’ll live to see such beast.</p>

<h2>How to Tackle all that stuff?</h2>

<p>Well, there is no universal formula. What follows is just my personal
suggestion.</p>

<h4>Squires</h4>

<p>If you’re an Emacs beginner start from the Emacs Tutorial and proceed
with the articles on Mastering
Emacs. <a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2011/10/09/getting-started-with-emacs-24/">Get a copy of Emacs 24</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> to start
off with a solid initial configuration.</p>

<p>Study the rest of the resources at your own discretion. Following
Twitter accounts has very low overhead for you and could be very beneficial.</p>

<h4>Knights</h4>

<p>Read the Emacs Manual. Read the Emacs Lisp Manual. Subscribe to Planet
Emacsen. Read the source code of Prelude or the ESK. The rest is totally up to you.</p>

<h4>Masters</h4>

<p>Read the Emacs source code. Contribute bug fixes and new modes. Share
your knowledge. Sharpen your Lisp skills.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>The road to Emacs mastery is a long and tiresome one. But it’s also
one of the most enjoyable roads one may choose to travel. Hopefully
you’ll enjoy it even more armed with the many resources I’ve listed
here.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the article I said I’m certainly going to miss
many great bits of Emacs wisdom. I’d like to ask you to mention them
in the comments section so that I could add them to the article.</p>
