<h2 class="chapter">10 Developing with Emacs</h2>

<h3 class="section">10.1 How do I use Emacs with Microsoft Visual C++</h3>

<p>There are two ways you can use Emacs in conjunction with MSVC.  You
can use Emacs as the editor, and do everything else in the DevStudio
IDE.  Or you can use Emacs as an IDE, calling the MSVC command line
tools to build your project.

</p><h4 class="subsection">10.1.1 Emacs as the text editor for DevStudio</h4>

<p><a name="index-DevStudio_002c-using-Emacs-as-editor-in-360"></a><a name="index-MSVC_002b_002b_002c-using-Emacs-as-editor-with-361"></a><a name="index-Visual-Studio_002c-using-Emacs-as-editor-in-362"></a><a name="index-VisEmacs_002c-add-in-for-MS-Developer-Studio-363"></a>
Christopher Payne wrote a Visual Studio add-in that makes Emacs the
default text editor, this has now been taken over by
<a href="mailto:paquette@mediaone.net">Jeff Paquette</a>. 
See the following two URLS for details:
     </p><ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/visemacs/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/visemacs/</a> for the latest version. 
</li><li><a href="http://www.smathers.net/VisEmacs.htm">http://www.smathers.net/VisEmacs.htm</a> for notes on usage. 
</li></ul>

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.2 Using MSVC command line tools from Emacs</h4>

<p><a name="index-MSVC_002b_002b_002c-compiling-within-Emacs-364"></a><a name="index-compile-365"></a>
This is an app note on how to use Microsoft Visual C++ with Emacs. The
experiments done below were done with Emacs 19.34.1 on Windows 95,
using Visual C++ 4.0 Standard Edition. Your mileage may vary.

   </p><p>This writeup assumes minimal knowledge of Emacs hacking on the part of
the reader.

</p><h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.2.1 VC++ Environment Variables</h5>

<p><a name="index-vcvars32_002ebat-366"></a><a name="index-MSVC_002b_002b_002c-environment-variables-367"></a>
There is a batch file in your VC++ installation's bin directory called
<samp><span class="file">vcvars32.bat</span></samp>, which sets up the environment variables needed to
run the VC++ command line tools.  Arrange for those same environment
variables to be set in your Emacs session.  You can do this on Windows
9x by calling the <samp><span class="file">vcvars32.bat</span></samp> script from <samp><span class="file">autoexec.bat</span></samp>. 
On other versions of Windows you can set the environment variables
globally using the System control panel.

   </p><p>For all versions of Windows you can alternatively set the variables
just inside Emacs by using <code>setenv</code> calls in your init file. 
See <a indepth="true" href="installing-emacs.html#Installing-Emacs">Where do I put my init file?</a>.

   </p><p>You should now be able to compile from Emacs. Load a source file from
a VC++ project. Type <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>. Replace the proposed command line
with:
</p><pre class="example">     nmake -f <var>ProjectName</var>.mak
</pre>
   <p>You will find that this defaults to a debug build. You can change it
to a release build with:
</p><pre class="example">     nmake -f <var>ProjectName</var>.mak CFG="<var>ProjectName</var> - Win32 Release"
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.2.2 Setting the default compile command</h5>

<p><a name="index-compile_002c-setting-default-command-368"></a><a name="index-nmake_002c-as-default-compile-command-369"></a><a name="index-compile_002dcommand-370"></a>
Now set the default value for the compile command line.  Add the
following to your init file:

</p><pre class="example">     ;; Set up for Visual C++ compiling
     (setq compile-command "nmake -f ")
</pre>
   <p>If you work on the same project long term, you can add the project
makefile to the string.

   </p><p><a href="mailto:sasdjb@unx.sas.com">David Biesack</a> suggests that perhaps it's
easy to write a <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> in the project directory which does

</p><pre class="example">     PROJECT=MyProject
     all: debug
     debug: FORCE
             nmake /f $(PROJECT).mak CFG="$(PROJECT) - Win32 Debug"
     release: FORCE
             nmake /f $(PROJECT).mak CFG="$(PROJECT) - Win32 Release"
     FORCE:
</pre>
   <p>and then you can simply change compile-command to <samp><span class="command">nmake</span></samp>.

   </p><p><a href="mailto:deupreec@interagp.com">Caleb T. Deupree</a> reports that on VC++
5.0 and up, "You can also set an option in Options/Build to export a
makefile every time the project is saved, which you can then use to
compile with ‘<samp><span class="samp">nmake -f project.mak</span></samp>’."  VC++ 4.0 builds the make file
every time, and there is no option.

</p><h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.2.3 Reverting Buffers</h5>

<p><a name="index-DevStudio_002c-keeping-source-in-sync-371"></a><a name="index-Visual-Studio_002c-keeping-source-in-sync-372"></a><a name="index-MSVC_002b_002b_002c-keeping-source-in-sync-373"></a><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dmode-374"></a><a name="index-global_002dauto_002drevert_002dmode-375"></a>
It is recommended that you use <code>auto-revert-mode</code> in buffers
that you have open in both Emacs and MSVC++ at the same time.  Then if
you mistakenly edit the file in MSVC++, Emacs will pick up your
changes immediately, rather than after you have written lots more code
and attempt to save.

</p><h5 class="subsubsection">10.1.2.4 Edit with Emacs function for MSVC</h5>

<p><a name="index-DevStudio_002c-load-in-Emacs-command-376"></a><a name="index-Visual-Studio_002c-load-in-Emacs-command-377"></a><a name="index-MSVC_002b_002b_002c-load-in-Emacs-command-378"></a><a name="index-emacsclient_002c-calling-from-Visual-Studio-379"></a>
You can also set up VC++ to import a file into Emacs for you, all
ready for editing.  In VC++, go to the <code>Tools</code> pull-down menu, and
click on <code>Customize...</code>.  In the <code>Tools</code> tab, click on
<code>Add</code>.  Use <code>Browse</code> to locate the
<samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp> file in your Emacs bin directory, and
select it.  For arguments, use <samp><span class="option">+$(CurLine)</span></samp>
<samp><span class="option">"$(FilePath)"</span></samp> and for the directory use the <code>$(WkspDir)</code>
(the quotes around FilePath handle paths with spaces in them). Set the
Menu Text to say "Em&amp;acs". The <samp><span class="option">+$(CurLine)</span></samp> will set point in
Emacs to the same line as the cursor position in VC++. The ampersand
in the word <code>Em&amp;acs</code> allows you to select emacs from the keyboard. (E
is already used for the OLE control test container.)

   </p><p>You should now be able to go to any source file in your project. Then,
use the pull-down menu <code>Tools-&gt;Emacs</code>. The active file in your
VC++ IDE should now be front and center in Emacs, all ready to edit as
you wish. If you use keystrokes to work the menus, try <kbd>Alt-T A</kbd> to
move the file into Emacs. Binding this tool to a keystroke will be
left as an exercise for the student.

   </p><p>If you have the option of saving files before running tools, make sure
this option is set. (I don't see it on VC++ 4.0.)

</p><h3 class="section">10.2 Emacs and Borland C++ Builder</h3>

<p><a name="index-Borland-C_002b_002b_002c-integration-with-Emacs-380"></a>
<a href="mailto:jdarnold@buddydog.org">Jonathan Arnold</a> has written an
<a href="http://www.buddydog.org/C++Builder/c++builder.html">EmacsEdit “expert”</a> for interfacing C++ Builder and Emacs.

</p><h3 class="section">10.3 Is there a version of my VC software I can use with Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-version-control_002c-integration-with-Emacs-381"></a><a name="index-revision-control_002c-integration-with-Emacs-382"></a><a name="index-source-control_002c--integration-with-Emacs-383"></a><a name="index-cvs_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-384"></a><a name="index-rcs_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-385"></a><a name="index-svn_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-386"></a><a name="index-git_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-387"></a><a name="index-bzr_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-388"></a><a name="index-arch_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-389"></a><a name="index-mercurial_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-390"></a><a name="index-hg_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-391"></a><a name="index-monotone_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-392"></a><a name="index-mcvs_002c-version-control-integration-with-Emacs-393"></a>
If you are using a graphical revision control tool already, check if
it comes with command-line tools.  Many such GUI tools are just
wrappers for the same command line tools that Emacs requires for its
VC integration.  Most of the supported VC systems have well supported
Free native Windows binaries.  For those that don't Cygwin may be an option.

</p><h3 class="section">10.4 How do I use the Perl debugger with Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-perl_002c-debugging-within-Emacs-394"></a><a name="index-perldb_002c-using-with-Emacs-395"></a>
From <a href="mailto:jay@rgrs.com">Jay Rogers</a>

   </p><p>Some versions of the perl debugger itself need to be patched to work
with emacs. They are perl versions 5.001 and less, and version
5.004_01. To fix, locate and change the code similar to the following
code in lib/perl5db.pl
</p><pre class="example">             if (-e "/dev/tty") {
                 $console = "/dev/tty";
                 $rcfile=".perldb";
             }
             elsif (-e "con") {
                 $console = "";                 &lt;---- change "con" to ""
                 $rcfile="perldb.ini";
             }
             else {
                 $console = "sys\$command";
                 $rcfile="perldb.ini";
             }
</pre>
   <p><a href="mailto:soup@ampersand.com">Doug Campbell</a> also has some
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/perldb">suggestions</a> for improving the interaction of perldb and Emacs.
