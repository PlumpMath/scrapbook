<h3 class="section">8.1 How do I use mail in Emacs?</h3>

<p>Emacs comes with several options for reading and writing mail.  These
are documented in the manual, and the choice of which method to use
depends on personal taste.  There are some issues specific to Windows
however, related to the fact that Windows machines do not have the
mail infrastructure that is commonly installed on other platforms, so
mail will not work without some configuration.

</p><h4 class="subsection">8.1.1 Outgoing mail</h4>

<p><a name="index-mail_002c-outgoing-280"></a><a name="index-smtp-server-281"></a><a name="index-user_002dfull_002dname-282"></a><a name="index-user_002dmail_002daddress-283"></a><a name="index-smtpmail_002ddefault_002dsmtp_002dserver-284"></a><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsmtp_002dserver-285"></a><a name="index-send_002dmail_002dcommand-286"></a><a name="index-message_002dsend_002dmail_002dfunction-287"></a><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsend_002dit-288"></a><a name="index-smtpmail_002ddebug_002dinfo-289"></a>
For outgoing mail, you will need to use <samp><span class="file">smtpmail.el</span></samp> which
allows Emacs to talk directly to SMTP mail servers.  This is included
with Emacs, and can be set up as follows:

</p><pre class="example">     (setq user-full-name "<var>Your full name</var>")
     (setq user-mail-address "<var>Your@email.address</var>")
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "<var>domain.name.of.your.smtp.server</var>")
     
     (setq send-mail-command 'smtpmail-send-it) ; For mail-mode (Rmail)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it) ; For message-mode (Gnus)
</pre>
   <p>Note that if you want to change the name of the SMTP server after
smtpmail is loaded, then you'll need to change
<code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code>.

   </p><p>If you are experiencing problems with sending large messages, check
the value of the variable <code>smtpmail-debug-info</code>. If it is non-nil, you
should set it to <code>nil</code>:

</p><h4 class="subsection">8.1.2 Incoming mail with Rmail and POP3</h4>

<p><a name="index-mail_002c-incoming-with-rmail-290"></a><a name="index-pop3_002c-using-rmail-291"></a><a name="index-rmail_002c-mail-client-292"></a><a name="index-movemail_002c-using-pop3-293"></a><a name="index-MAILHOST-294"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dprimary_002dinbox_002dlist-295"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dpop_002dpassword_002drequired-296"></a>
For incoming mail using the Rmail package and a POP3 server, you will
need the following configuration:

</p><pre class="example">     (setenv "MAILHOST" "<var>domain.name.of.your.pop3.server</var>")
     (setq rmail-primary-inbox-list '("po:<var>your logon id</var>"))
     (setq rmail-pop-password-required t)
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">8.1.3 Incoming mail with Gnus</h4>

<p><a name="index-mail_002c-incoming-with-Gnus-297"></a><a name="index-pop3_002c-using-Gnus-298"></a><a name="index-imap_002c-using-Gnus-299"></a><a name="index-gnus_002c-mail-and-news-client-300"></a>
Although Gnus started life as a Usenet news reader, it also makes a
good mail reader, particularly if you subscribe to a lot of mailing
lists, or you want to use IMAP rather than POP3, which is not
supported by Rmail.  Because of the varied ways of setting up Gnus,
it is best that you read the Gnus manual, and seek help on
<a href="news:gnu.emacs.gnus">news:gnu.emacs.gnus</a> if needed.

</p><h4 class="subsection">8.1.4 Other incoming mail options</h4>

<p><a name="index-mail_002c-other-options-301"></a><a name="index-wanderlust_002c-mail-and-news-client-302"></a><a name="index-vm_002c-mail-client-303"></a><a name="index-mh_002de_002c-mail-client-304"></a>
Other options for reading mail in Emacs include VM, MH-E and
Wanderlust.  All of these require lisp or executable code that does
not come with Emacs, so you should seek help where you obtained the
packages from if you want to use them.

</p><h3 class="section">8.2 How do I open attachments in Gnus?</h3>

<p><a name="index-gnus_002c-attachments-305"></a><a name="index-attachments_002c-in-gnus-306"></a><a name="index-mail_002c-attachments-in-gnus-307"></a><a name="index-g_t_002emailcap-308"></a><a name="index-MIME_002c-configuration-for-Gnus-309"></a>
In your <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> directory create a file called <samp><span class="file">.mailcap</span></samp>,
with contents like the following:
</p><pre class="example">     application/zip "C:/Program Files/7-Zip/7zFM.exe"
     video/* "C:/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc.exe"
</pre>
   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Associating MIME types with <samp><span class="command">start</span></samp> or other
generic Windows commands to open arbitrary files might seem like a
good idea, but it leaves your system as open to attack as Outlook
Express was at its worst.  Especially dangerous is associating
application/* or */* in this way.

</p><h3 class="section">8.3 How do I use FTP within Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-ftp_002c-using-within-Emacs-310"></a><a name="index-ange_002dftp-311"></a><a name="index-tramp_002c-ftp-312"></a><a name="index-remote-hosts-via-ftp-313"></a><a name="index-ange_002dftp_002dftp_002dprogram_002dname-314"></a>
Windows built in FTP client can be used with ange-ftp.  Ange-ftp is
the Emacs package that provides FTP connectivity to tramp, a
multi-protocol remote file access package for Emacs that is enabled by
default.

   </p><p>The Windows FTP client does have problems with some firewalls, due to
lack of passive mode support, so you may want to try an alternative
ftp client instead.  Make sure that the client you are trying is in
your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> before the default Windows client, or rename the
default Windows client to avoid it getting in the way.  Alternatively
you can customize <code>ange-ftp-ftp-program-name</code> to the full path to
the version you are trying.  See <a indepth="true" href="other-useful-ports.html#Other-useful-ports">Other useful ports</a>.

</p><h3 class="section">8.4 How do I use Tramp to work in Emacs via SSH?</h3>

<p><a name="index-tramp_002c-ssh-315"></a><a name="index-ssh_002c-accessing-remote-hosts-within-Emacs-316"></a><a name="index-remote-hosts-via-ssh-317"></a><a name="index-openssh-318"></a><a name="index-PuTTY-319"></a><a name="index-plink-320"></a><a name="index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod-321"></a><a name="index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod_002dalist-322"></a>
Tramp can use a number of protocols to connect to remote machines to
read files and even run commands on those files remotely.  A popular
one is ssh.  As well as Cygwin versions of openssh, you can use
PuTTY's command line plink program as the ssh client.  The relevant
methods to use in <code>tramp-default-method</code> or
<code>tramp-default-method-alist</code> for these options are:
     </p><ul>
<li>openssh
          <ul>
<li><code>scp</code> Uses scp for copying, ssh for shell operations. 
</li><li><code>scp1</code> scp with forced SSH protocol version 1
</li><li><code>scp2</code> scp with forced SSH protocol version 2
</li><li><code>ssh</code> Uses ssh with encoding on stdin/stdout for file transfer. 
</li><li><code>ssh1</code> ssh with forced SSH protocol version 1
</li><li><code>ssh2</code> ssh with forced SSH protocol version 2
</li></ul>

     </li><li>PuTTY
          <ul>
<li><code>pscp</code> Uses pscp for copying, plink for shell operations. 
</li><li><code>pscp1</code> pscp, with forced SSH protocol version 1
</li><li><code>pscp2</code> pscp, with forced SSH protocol version 2
</li><li><code>plink</code> Uses plink with encoding on stdin/stdout for file transfer. 
</li><li><code>plink1</code> plink with forced SSH protocol version 1
</li><li><code>plink2</code> plink with forced SSH protocol version 2
</li></ul>
     </li></ul>

<h3 class="section">8.5 How do I use telnet with Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-telnet_002c-in-Emacs-323"></a><a name="index-telnet-324"></a><a name="index-telnet-client_002c-that-works-with-Emacs-325"></a>
To use telnet-mode on Windows, you need a telnet client that uses
stdin and stdout for input and output.  The default Windows client is
a Windows application, and will not work as a subprocess.  Several
options exist, but information that was formerly in this FAQ is out of
date now, so no concrete pointers are available.
