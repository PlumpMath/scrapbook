<p><a name="index-quoting-arguments-to-subprocesses-210"></a><a name="index-sub_002dprocesses_002c-quoting-arguments-to-211"></a><a name="index-cygwin_002c-quoting-arguments-212"></a>
The quoting rules for native Windows shells and Cygwin shells have
some subtle differences.  When Emacs spawns subprocesses, it tries to
determine whether the process is a Cygwin program and changes its
quoting mechanism appropriately.  See this
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/shell-quoting">previous discussion</a> for details.

</p><h3 class="section">7.2 Programs reading input hang</h3>

<p><a name="index-subprocesses_002c-hanging-when-reading-input-213"></a><a name="index-full_002dscreen-console-programs_002c-as-subprocesses-214"></a><a name="index-ftp_002c-client-hanging-215"></a><a name="index-ftp-216"></a>
Programs that explicitly use a handle to the console (<samp><span class="file">CON</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">CON:</span></samp>) instead of stdin and stdout cannot be used as
subprocesses to Emacs, and they will also not work in shell-mode.  The
default ftp client on Windows is an example of such a program - this
ftp program is mostly fine for use with <code>ange-ftp</code> or
<code>tramp</code>, but not for <kbd>M-x ftp</kbd> (see <a indepth="true" href="network-access.html#Network-access">How do I use FTP within Emacs</a>).  There is no convenient way for either Emacs
or any shell used in <code>shell-mode</code> to redirect the input and
output of such processes from the console to input and output pipes. 
The only workaround is to use a different implementation of the
program that does not use the console directly.  Microsoft's new

</p><h3 class="section">7.3 Buffering in shells and subprocesses</h3>

<p><a name="index-subprocesses_002c-buffering-output-217"></a><a name="index-output-not-displaying_002c-subprocesses-218"></a><a name="index-SQL-subprocess-hanging-219"></a><a name="index-cvs-hanging-when-login-needed-220"></a><a name="index-ssh_002c-password-prompt-not-appearing-when-using-with-cvs-221"></a><a name="index-sql_002dmode-222"></a><a name="index-shell_002dmode-223"></a><a name="index-setbuf_002c-using-in-subprocesses-to-prevent-buffering-224"></a><a name="index-setvbuf_002c-using-in-subprocesses-to-prevent-buffering-225"></a>
You may notice that some programs, when run in a shell in
<code>shell-mode</code>,
have their output buffered (e.g., people have found this happening to
them with <code>sql-mode</code>).  When the program has a lot of output, it
overflows the buffering and gets printed to the shell buffer; however,
if the program only outputs a small amount of text, it will remain
buffered and won't appear in the shell buffer.  The same can happen
in other subprocesses that themselves run other programs as
subprocesses, for example when using <samp><span class="command">cvs</span></samp> from Emacs, which
is itself configured to use <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, password prompts fail to
appear when expected, and <samp><span class="command">cvs</span></samp> appears to hang.

   </p><p>Although it may at first seem like the shell is buffering the output
from the program, it is actually the program that is buffering
output.  The C runtime typically decides how to buffer output based
upon whether stdout is bound to a handle to a console window or
not.  If bound to a console window, output is buffered line by line; if
bound to a block device, such as a file, output is buffered block by
block.

   </p><p>In a shell buffer, stdout is a pipe handle and so is buffered in
blocks.  If you would like the buffering behavior of your program to
behave differently, the program itself is going to have to be changed;
you can use <code>setbuf</code> and <code>setvbuf</code> to manipulate
the buffering semantics.

   </p><p>Some programs handle this by having an explicit flag to control their
buffering behaviour, typically <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> for interactive.  Other
programs manage to detect that they are running under Emacs, by
using ‘<samp><span class="samp">getenv("emacs")</span></samp>’ internally.

</p><h4 class="subsection">7.3.1 Perl script buffering</h4>

<p><a name="index-perl_002c-avoiding-buffering-when-used-as-a-subprocess-of-Emacs-226"></a>
A handy solution for Perl scripts to the above problem is to use:

</p><pre class="example">     # Turn all buffering off.
     select((select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);
     select((select(STDERR), $| = 1)[0]);
     select((select(STDIN), $| = 1)[0]);
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">7.4 16-bit subprocesses accessing the floppy drive</h3>

<p><a name="index-floppy-drive_002c-access-when-subprocesses-started-227"></a><a name="index-subprocess-starting-causes-floppy-drive-access-228"></a>
If you are finding the 16 bit DOS subprocesses cause your A: drive to
be accessed, hanging Emacs until the read times out if there is no
floppy in the drive, check to see if your virus software is causing
the problem.

</p><h3 class="section">7.5 Killing subprocesses on Windows 95/98/Me</h3>

<p><a name="index-subprocess_002c-killing-on-Windows-95_002f98_002fME-229"></a><a name="index-killing-subprocesses_002c-Windows-95_002f98_002fME-230"></a><a name="index-shutdown_002c-complaints-about-cmdproxy_002eexe-running-231"></a>
Emacs cannot guarantee that a subprocess gets killed on Windows 95 and
its descendants, and it is a difficult limitation to work around.  To
avoid problems on these systems, you should let subprocesses run to
completion including explicitly exiting shells before killing the
associated buffer.

   </p><p>If you find that while shutting down, Windows complains that there is
a running <samp><span class="command">cmdproxy.exe</span></samp> even though you carefully exited all
shells and none were showing in Task Manager before the shutdown, this
could be due to buggy interaction with your virus scanner.

</p><h3 class="section">7.6 Sending EOF to subprocesses</h3>

<p><a name="index-EOF_002c-sending-to-subprocesses-232"></a><a name="index-shell-terminates-when-EOF-sent-to-subprocess-233"></a><a name="index-process_002dsend_002deof-234"></a>
When an EOF is sent to a subprocess running in an interactive shell
with <code>process-send-eof</code>, the shell terminates unexpectedly as
if its input was closed.  This affects the use of <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> in
shell buffers.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/todo/shell-ctrl-d">this discussion</a> for more details.

</p><h3 class="section">7.7 How do I use a shell in Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-interactive-shell_002c-using-235"></a><a name="index-shell-within-emacs_002c-using-236"></a><a name="index-shell-237"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand-238"></a><a name="index-shell_002dfile_002dname-239"></a><a name="index-explicit_002dshell_002dfile_002dname-240"></a>
You can start an interactive shell in Emacs by typing <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>. 
Emacs uses the <samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> environment variable to determine which
program to use as the shell.  To instruct Emacs to use a non-default
shell, you can either set this environment variable, or customize
<code>explicit-shell-file-name</code>.  You can also customize
<code>shell-file-name</code> to change the shell that will be used by
subprocesses that are started with <code>shell-command</code> and
related non-interactive shell commands.

</p><h4 class="subsection">7.7.1 bash</h4>

<p><a name="index-cygwin-bash-as-shell-within-Emacs-241"></a><a name="index-shell_002c-using-cygwin-bash-within-Emacs-242"></a><a name="index-bash_002c-using-cygwin-shell-within-Emacs-243"></a><a name="index-comint_002dscroll_002dshow_002dmaximum_002doutput-244"></a><a name="index-comint_002dcompletion_002daddsuffix-245"></a><a name="index-comint_002deol_002don_002dsend-246"></a><a name="index-w32_002dquote_002dprocess_002dargs-247"></a><a name="index-shell_002dmode_002dhook-248"></a>
Cygwin bash is a popular shell for use with Emacs.  To use bash as the
default shell in Emacs, you can place the following in your init file:

</p><pre class="example">     (defun my-shell-setup ()
       "For Cygwin bash under Emacs 20"
       (setq comint-scroll-show-maximum-output 'this)
       (make-variable-buffer-local 'comint-completion-addsuffix))
       (setq comint-completion-addsuffix t)
       ;; (setq comint-process-echoes t) ;; reported that this is no longer needed
       (setq comint-eol-on-send t)
       (setq w32-quote-process-args ?\")
     
     (setq shell-mode-hook 'my-shell-setup)
</pre>
   <p>If you find that you are having trouble with Emacs tracking drive
changes with bash, see <a href="mailto:mike.fabian@it-mannesmann.de">Mike Fabian</a>'s
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/drive-tracking">note</a>.

   </p><p>WARNING: Some versions of bash set and use the environment variable
PID.  For some as yet unknown reason, if <samp><span class="env">PID</span></samp> is set and Emacs
passes it on to bash subshells, bash dies (Emacs can inherit the
<samp><span class="env">PID</span></samp> variable if it's started from a bash shell).  If you clear
the <samp><span class="env">PID</span></samp> variable in your init file, you should be able to
continue to use bash as your subshell:
</p><pre class="example">         (setenv "PID" nil)
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">7.8 How do I use Cygwin style paths in Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-cygwin-paths_002c-using-within-Emacs-249"></a><a name="index-mount-points_002c-cygwin-250"></a><a name="index-cygwin-mount-points_002c-using-within-Emacs-251"></a>
The package
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/cygwin-mount.el">cygwin-mount.el</a> teaches Emacs about Cygwin mount points.

</p><h3 class="section">7.9 How do I make dired use my ls program?</h3>

<p><a name="index-dired_002c-using-an-external-ls-program-252"></a><a name="index-dired_002c-interpreting-symlinks-the-same-way-as-cygwin-253"></a><a name="index-symlinks-in-dired_002c-interpreting-the-same-way-as-cygwin-254"></a><a name="index-cygwin-symlinks-in-dired-255"></a><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002duse_002dinsert_002ddirectory_002dprogram-256"></a><a name="index-insert_002ddirectory_002dprogram-257"></a>
Dired uses an internal lisp implementation of <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> by default
on Windows.  For consistent display of symbolic links and other
information with other programs (eg Cygwin) and performance reasons,
you may want to use a Windows port of <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> instead.

</p><pre class="example">     (setq ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program t)      ;; use external ls
     (setq insert-directory-program "c:/cygwin/bin/ls") ;; ls program name
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">7.10 How do I prevent shell commands from being echoed?</h3>

<p><a name="index-echo_002c-suppressing-for-shell-input-258"></a><a name="index-shell-commands_002c-suppressing-echo-259"></a><a name="index-comint_002dprocess_002dechoes-260"></a><a name="index-comint_002dmode_002dhook-261"></a><a name="index-explicit_002dcmd_002eexe_002dargs-262"></a><a name="index-explicit_002dcmdproxy_002eexe_002dargs-263"></a><a name="index-explicit_002dbash_002eexe_002dargs-264"></a><a name="index-explicit_002dbash_002dargs-265"></a><a name="index-shell-specific-arguments-266"></a>
Some shells echo the commands that you send to them, and the echoed
commands appear in the output buffer.  In particular, the default
shells, <samp><span class="command">command.com</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">cmd.exe</span></samp>, have this behavior.

   </p><p>To prevent echoed commands from being printed, you can place the
following in your init file:

</p><pre class="example">         (defun my-comint-init ()
           (setq comint-process-echoes t))
         (add-hook 'comint-mode-hook 'my-comint-init)
</pre>
   <p>If <code>shell-mode</code> still is not stripping echoed commands, then
you'll have to explicitly tell the shell to not echo commands.  You can
do this by setting the <code>explicit-</code><var>SHELL</var><code>-args</code> variable
appropriately; where <var>SHELL</var> is the value of your <samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp>
environment variable (do a <kbd>M-: (getenv "SHELL")</kbd> to see what it
is currently set to).  Assuming that you are on NT and that your
<samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> environment variable is set to <samp><span class="command">cmd.exe</span></samp>,
then placing the following in your init file will tell
<samp><span class="command">cmd.exe</span></samp> to not echo commands:

</p><pre class="example">         (setq explicit-cmd.exe-args '("/q"))
</pre>
   <p>The comint package will use the value of this variable as an argument
to <samp><span class="command">cmd.exe</span></samp> every time it starts up a new shell; the
<samp><span class="option">/q</span></samp> is the argument to <samp><span class="command">cmd.exe</span></samp> that stops the
echoing (invoking ‘<samp><span class="samp">cmd /?</span></samp>’ in a shell will show you all of the
command line arguments to <samp><span class="command">cmd.exe</span></samp>).

   </p><p>Note that this variable is case sensitive; if the value of your
<samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> environment variable is <samp><span class="command">CMD.EXE</span></samp> instead, then
this variable needs to be named <code>explicit-CMD.EXE-args</code> instead.

</p><h3 class="section">7.11 How can I make shell completion use forward slashes?</h3>

<p><a name="index-completion_002c-using-forward-slashes-in-shell-buffers-267"></a><a name="index-forward-slashes-for-completion-in-shell-buffers-268"></a><a name="index-comint_002dcompletion_002daddsuffix-269"></a>
The character appended to directory names when completing in a shell
buffer is controlled by the variable <code>comint-completion-addsuffix</code>. 
See its documentation (with <kbd>C-h v</kbd>) for details.

</p><h3 class="section">7.12 Why do I get incorrect DOS version messages?</h3>

<p><a name="index-nmake_002c-Incorrect-DOS-version-messages-270"></a><a name="index-shell_002c-Incorrect-DOS-version-messages-271"></a><a name="index-COMSPEC_002c-effect-on-subprocesses-of-subprocesses-272"></a>
This might happen if, for example, you invoke <samp><span class="command">nmake</span></samp> in a
shell and it tries to create sub-shells.  The problem happens because
when the shell is initially created, the first argument to the shell
is not the directory in which the shell program resides.  When this
happens, <samp><span class="command">command.com</span></samp> fabricates a value for its
<samp><span class="env">COMSPEC</span></samp> environment variable that is incorrect.  Then, when
other programs go to use <samp><span class="env">COMSPEC</span></samp> to find the shell, they are
given the wrong value.

   </p><p>The fix for this is to either prevent any arguments from being sent to
the shell when it starts up (in which case <samp><span class="command">command.com</span></samp> will
use a default, and correct, value for <samp><span class="env">COMSPEC</span></samp>), or to have the
first argument be the directory in which the shell executable resides.

</p><h3 class="section">7.13 Why is nothing happening when I enter shell commands?</h3>

<p><a name="index-shell-commands-not-working-273"></a><a name="index-anti_002dvirus-software_002c-bad-interaction-with-274"></a><a name="index-virus-software_002c-bad-interaction-with-275"></a><a name="index-firewall_002c-bad-interaction-with-276"></a><a name="index-scan-all-files_002c-anti_002dvirus-option-causing-problems-277"></a><a name="index-auto-protect_002c-anti_002dvirus-option-causing-problems-278"></a><a name="index-shell_002c-interacting-badly-with-anti_002dvirus-279"></a>
Some anti-virus software has been reported to cause problems with
shells in the past.  Try turning off options such as “Scan all
files”.  See <a indepth="true" href="installing-emacs.html#Installing-Emacs">What known problems are there with anti-virus software?</a>.
