     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs on MS
     Windows with answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other
     languages, transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info,
     WWW), and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

</p><h3 class="section">11.1 Cygwin</h3>

<p><a name="index-cygwin-environment-398"></a><a name="index-cygwin_002c-library-conflicts-399"></a><a name="index-library-conflicts-with-cygwin-400"></a><a name="index-interoperability-with-cygwin-401"></a><a name="index-subprocesses_002c-cygwin-tools-402"></a><a name="index-exec_002dpath-403"></a>
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>.

   </p><p>Cygwin is a popular complete POSIX emulation environment for Windows. 
Most of its tools can be used with Emacs, and it covers a wide range
of ported software.  The main shell used by Cygwin is GNU
<samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>, but other shells are also available.  Some Cygwin
tools may not interoperate well with Emacs or other native Windows
tools, due to the total immersion aspect of Cygwin, including its
non-native filesystem mapping.

   </p><p>If you choose to use Cygwin, then its tools will probably be all that
you need, but you will need to get image libraries from elsewhere, as
the Cygwin ones are not compatible with non-Cygwin software.  In fact,
if Cygwin is on your PATH when you run Emacs, and Emacs does not find
other versions of the image libraries first, then the Cygwin ones can
cause problems.  Cygwin developers recommend that you do not put
Cygwin on your system <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> for this reason.  Instead you can
make the Cygwin tools available within Emacs by setting <code>exec-path</code>
in your init file.

</p><h3 class="section">11.2 MinGW and MSYS</h3>

<p><a name="index-mingw-tools-404"></a><a name="index-msys-environment-405"></a><a name="index-subprocesses_002c-mingw-and-msys-406"></a>
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</a>

   </p><p>MinGW is a set of development tools that produce native Windows
executables, not dependent on Cygwin's POSIX emulation DLLs.

   </p><p>MSYS is a POSIX shell and minimal set of tools that are commonly used in
configure scripts.  Like Cygwin, this environment uses a non-native
filesystem mapping to appear more POSIX like to the scripts that it
runs.  This is intended to complement the MinGW tools to make it easier
to port software to Windows.

</p><h3 class="section">11.3 UWIN</h3>

<p><a name="index-uwin-environment-407"></a><a name="index-subprocesses_002c-uwin-408"></a>
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/">http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/</a>

   </p><p>UWIN is another POSIX emulation environment, like Cygwin and MSYS,
that provides a large number of ported tools.  The shell used by UWIN
is <samp><span class="command">ksh</span></samp>, the Korn shell.

</p><h3 class="section">11.4 GnuWin32</h3>

<p><a name="index-gnuwin32-tools-409"></a><a name="index-subprocesses_002c-gnuwin32-410"></a><a name="index-image-libraries_002c-gnuwin32-411"></a><a name="index-image-libraries_002c-development-412"></a>
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/</a>

   </p><p>GnuWin32 provides precompiled native Windows ports of a wide selection
of Free software and libraries.  Tools available here that are useful
for Emacs include:

     </p><ul>
<li>Arc - used by <code>archive-mode</code> to edit .arc files. 
</li><li>Bzip2 - used by Emacs to automatically decompress .bz2 files. 
</li><li>CompFace - used by <code>gnus</code> to display XFace headers in messages. 
</li><li>CoreUtils - GNU file, shell and text utilities (also in MSYS)
</li><li>DiffUtils - for <code>ediff</code> and producing patches
</li><li>FindUtils - for <code>grep-find</code> and other file searches. 
</li><li>GifLib - library to support GIF images. 
</li><li>Grep - for searching through files with <code>grep</code>. 
</li><li>Gzip - used by Emacs to automatically decompress .gz files. 
</li><li>Jpeg - library to support JPEG images (also in GTK). 
</li><li>Lha - used by <code>archive-mode</code> to edit .lzh files. 
</li><li>LibPng - library to support PNG images (also in GTK). 
</li><li>LibTiff - library to support TIFF images (also in GTK). 
</li><li>Make - used by <code>compile</code> for building projects (also in MinGW)
</li><li>OpenSSL - used by <code>gnus</code> to talk to servers over SSL. 
</li><li>Patch - used by <code>ediff-patch-file</code> and others to apply patches. 
</li><li>Tar - used by <code>tar-mode</code> to edit tar files. 
</li><li>TexInfo - used to build Emacs' manuals. 
</li><li>Unzip - used by <code>archive-mode</code> for extracting zip files. 
</li><li>Xpm - library to support XPM images (bundled with Emacs binaries)
</li><li>Zip - used by <code>archive-mode</code> for editing zip files. 
</li><li>Zlib - required by LibPng (also in GTK). 
</li></ul>

<h3 class="section">11.5 GTK</h3>

<p><a name="index-GTK-image-libraries-413"></a><a name="index-image-libraries_002c-GTK-414"></a><a name="index-addpm_002c-using-GTK-image-libraries-415"></a>
GTK is a potential source for some of the image libraries that Emacs
requires.  GTK is installed along with other ports of GUI software,
such as the GIMP image editor, and Pidgin instant messenger client. 
If GTK is installed when you run <samp><span class="command">addpm</span></samp>, Emacs will use the
image libraries that it provides, even if they are not on the
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  GTK ships with JPEG, PNG and TIFF support.

</p><h3 class="section">11.6 How do I read man pages?</h3>

<p><a name="index-man-pages-416"></a><a name="index-woman-417"></a><a name="index-man-418"></a>
Man pages for Emacs and other ported programs that you have can be
read using Emacs' built-in manual reader <code>woman</code>.  This
requires no external programs, but if you do have a port of
<samp><span class="command">man</span></samp>, there is also an Emacs wrapper <code>man</code> that
which may be slightly faster.
