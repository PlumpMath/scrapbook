<h2 class="chapter">9 Text and Utility modes</h2>

<h3 class="section">9.1 How do I use TeX with Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-tex-326"></a><a name="index-typesetting-327"></a>
You will need an implementation of TeX for Windows. 
A number of implementations are listed on the
<a href="http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free">TeX Users Group</a> website.

</p><h4 class="subsection">9.1.1 AUCTeX</h4>

<p><a name="index-auctex_002c-precompiled-for-Windows-328"></a><a name="index-latex-329"></a><a name="index-preview_002dlatex-330"></a>
AUCTeX is an Emacs package for writing LaTeX files, which also
includes preview-latex, an Emacs mode for previewing the formatted
contents of LaTeX documents.  Pre-compiled versions for Windows are
available from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/download-for-windows.html">the AUCTeX site</a>.

</p><h3 class="section">9.2 How do I perform spell checks?</h3>

<p><a name="index-spell-checking-331"></a><a name="index-ispell-332"></a><a name="index-aspell-333"></a><a name="index-flyspell-334"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dprogram_002dname-335"></a><a name="index-flyspell_002dmode-336"></a>
Emacs has support for spell checking on demand (<code>ispell</code>) and as
your type (<code>flyspell</code>).  Both packages depend on a copy of
<samp><span class="command">ispell</span></samp> 3.2 or a compatible spell-checking program. 
GNU Aspell is a popular choice these days, Windows installers are
available from the <a href="http://aspell.net/win32/">official site</a>.

   </p><p>Once installed, you will need to configure <code>ispell-program-name</code>
to tell ispell and flyspell to use <samp><span class="command">aspell</span></samp> as a replacement for
ispell.  You can include the full path to the <samp><span class="file">aspell</span></samp> binary, which
means you do not need to add its installation directory to the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.

</p><h3 class="section">9.3 Emacs and encryption</h3>

<p><a name="index-encryption-337"></a><a name="index-gpg_002c-Windows-binaries-338"></a><a name="index-pgp-encryption_002c-with-GNU-Privacy-Guard-339"></a><a name="index-signatures-on-Emacs-distribution_002c-checking-340"></a><a name="index-Emacs-distribution_002c-checking-digital-signatures-341"></a>
GNU Privacy Guard is a Free replacement for PGP, with Windows binaries
available.  See <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a>.

</p><h3 class="section">9.4 Why doesn't my wheel mouse work in Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-mouse-wheel-342"></a><a name="index-wheel-mouse-343"></a><a name="index-middle-button_002c-on-wheel-mouse-344"></a><a name="index-scrolling_002c-with-mouse-wheel-345"></a>
Some wheel mice ship with default settings that do not send the
standard wheel events to programs, but instead try to simulate scroll
bar events.  Usually this is configurable from the hardware specific
pages on the mouse control panel.  The middle button is often mapped
in the same settings to have some functionality other than sending
middle mouse button events.  In some cases, uninstalling the
manufacturer's drivers and telling Windows to use the generic USB or
PS/2 drivers is the only way to make the mouse work properly.

</p><h3 class="section">9.5 How do I use grep with Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-searching-through-files-with-grep-346"></a><a name="index-grep-347"></a><a name="index-findstr-348"></a><a name="index-grep-349"></a>
The best way to use <kbd>M-x grep</kbd> with Emacs is to download a port of
GNU <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>. See <a indepth="true" href="other-useful-ports.html#Other-useful-ports">Other useful ports</a>.

   </p><p>If you want a quick solution without installing extra tools, a poor
substitute that works for simple text searches is to specify the built
in Windows command <samp><span class="command">findstr</span></samp> as the command to run at the
<kbd>M-x grep</kbd> prompt.  Normally you will want to use the <samp><span class="option">/n</span></samp>
argument to <samp><span class="command">findstr</span></samp>.

</p><h4 class="subsection">9.5.1 How do I do a recursive grep?</h4>

<p><a name="index-recursive-searching-with-grep-350"></a><a name="index-grep_002c-recursive-through-subdirectories-351"></a><a name="index-findstr_002c-recursive-352"></a><a name="index-find_002c-using-with-grep-353"></a><a name="index-find_002c-the-POSIX-command-354"></a><a name="index-rgrep-355"></a><a name="index-grep_002dfind-356"></a><a name="index-find_002dgrep_002ddired-357"></a><a name="index-find_002dprogram-358"></a><a name="index-grep_002dfind_002dcommand-359"></a>
The Emacs commands <code>rgrep</code>, <code>grep-find</code>
and <code>find-grep-dired</code> are all different interfaces for
grepping recursively into subdirectories.  By default, they use the
command <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> to determine which files to work on, and either
run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> directly from find, or use <samp><span class="command">xargs</span></samp> to batch
up files and reduce the number of invocations of <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>.

   </p><p>Windows also comes with a <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> command, but it is not in any
way compatible with the POSIX <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> that Emacs tries to use. 
Emacs expects a <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> compatible with GNU findutils. 
See <a indepth="true" href="other-useful-ports.html#Other-useful-ports">Other useful ports</a>.  After you have installed it, you will need
to make sure that Emacs finds this version, not the standard Windows
<samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> command.  You can do this by either renaming the
Windows command, changing your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> to ensure that the directory
containing the findutils <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp> directory comes before the Windows
system directory, or set the variable <code>find-program</code> to the full
path to the findutils <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> command.

   </p><p>An alternative if you have a recent version of grep is to customize
<code>grep-find-command</code> to use ‘<samp><span class="samp">grep -r</span></samp>’ instead of both find
and grep.  Another alternative if you don't need the full capabilities
of grep is to use ‘<samp><span class="samp">findstr /n /r</span></samp>’.
