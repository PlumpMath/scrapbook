<h3 class="section">4.1 Emacs in console mode goes beyond the window size</h3>

<p><a name="index-console_002c-window-size-124"></a><a name="index-telnet_002c-display-size-problems-running-emacs-over-125"></a><a name="index-g_t_002dnw_002c-window-size-126"></a><a name="index-w32_002duse_002dfull_002dscreen_002dbuffer-127"></a>
The variable <code>w32-use-full-screen-buffer</code> controls whether Emacs uses
the window size or buffer size to determine the number of lines on screen. 
Normally the window size is correct, but when running Emacs over some
telnet servers, the buffer size needs to be used.  Emacs tries to guess
the correct value at startup, but if it guesses wrong, you can customize
that variable yourself.

</p><h3 class="section">4.2 What do I do if I have problems with my mouse buttons?</h3>

<p><a name="index-mouse-buttons_002c-problems-with-128"></a><a name="index-g_t2-button-mouse-129"></a><a name="index-two-button-mouse-130"></a><a name="index-third-mouse-button_002c-simulating-131"></a><a name="index-middle-mouse-button_002c-simulating-132"></a><a name="index-simulating-three-button-mouse-with-two-buttons-133"></a><a name="index-swap-right-and-middle-mouse-buttons-134"></a><a name="index-exchange-mouse_002d2-and-mouse_002d3-buttons-135"></a><a name="index-w32_002dmouse_002dbutton_002dtolerance-136"></a><a name="index-w32_002dnum_002dmouse_002dbuttons-137"></a><a name="index-w32_002dswap_002dmouse_002dbuttons-138"></a>
Emacs assigns bindings assuming a three button mouse.  On Windows, if
a two button mouse is detected, a hack is enabled which lets you
simulate the third button by pressing both mouse buttons
simultaneously.  <code>w32-mouse-button-tolerance</code> defines the timeout
for what is considered “simultaneous”.  You can check how many
buttons Emacs thinks your mouse has with <kbd>C-h v</kbd>
<code>w32-num-mouse-buttons</code>.

   </p><p>If you find yourself needing the mouse-3 bindings more often than mouse-2,
you can swap the buttons with the following code in your init file:
</p><pre class="example">     (setq w32-swap-mouse-buttons t)
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">4.3 How do I cut and paste text with NUL characters?</h3>

<p><a name="index-clipboard_002c-NUL-characters-139"></a>
If you attempt to cut and paste text with NUL characters embedded in it,
then the text will be truncated at the first NUL character.  This is a
limitation of the Windows clipboard, and does not affect killing and yanking
from the kill-ring within Emacs.

</p><h3 class="section">4.4 How can I fix garbled text yanked from the clipboard?</h3>

<p><a name="index-clipboard_002c-corruption-of-140"></a><a name="index-garbage-on-the-clipboard-141"></a><a name="index-clipboard-encoding-142"></a><a name="index-encoding_002c-clipboard-143"></a><a name="index-set_002dselection_002dcoding_002dsystem-144"></a>
You can try <code>set-selection-coding-system</code>, but generally such
corruption is a thing of the past, as Emacs uses Unicode for the clipboard
by default now.

</p><h3 class="section">4.5 How do I change the sound of the Emacs beep?</h3>

<p><a name="index-beep_002c-changing-the-sound-145"></a><a name="index-sound_002c-changing-the-beep-146"></a><a name="index-set_002dmessage_002dbeep-147"></a>
You can use the function <code>set-message-beep</code> to change the sound
that Emacs uses for its beep.  This affects both console and GUI frames. 
The doc string contains a list of the system sounds you can use.
