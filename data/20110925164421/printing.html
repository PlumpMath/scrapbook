</p><h3 class="section">6.1 How do I print from Emacs?</h3>

<p>A lot of effort has gone into making it easier to print from Emacs on
Windows and DOS, but this has still been insufficient to keep up with
changes in printing technology from text and postscript based printers
connected via ports that can be accessed directly, to graphical
printers that are only accessible via USB.  The changes do however
make old information on the subject redundant, so you need to make
sure any instructions you are following are up to date.  For that
reason, the old information from this FAQ has been removed, and you
are advised to check the
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PrintingFromEmacs">Emacs Wiki</a> for more up to date information.
