<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-scope-of-FAQ-1"></a>
This FAQ covers questions that are specific to running GNU Emacs on Windows. 
In this version of the FAQ, information that was out of date, covered in
the manuals or not specific to Windows has been removed. 
See <a indepth="true" href="further-information.html#Further-information">Further information</a>.

</p><h3 class="section">1.1 Why support GNU Emacs on Windows?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Why-Windows-2"></a>
It is not our goal to “help Windows users” by making text editing
on Windows more convenient.  We aim to replace proprietary software,
not to enhance it.  So why support GNU Emacs on Windows?

   </p><p>We hope that the experience of using GNU Emacs on Windows will give
programmers a taste of freedom, and that this will later inspire them
to move to a free operating system such as GNU/Linux.  That is the
main valid reason to support free applications on nonfree operating
systems.

</p><h3 class="section">1.2 Which versions of Windows are supported?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Windows_002c-versions-3"></a><a name="index-supported-versions-of-Windows-4"></a>
Emacs 23.3 is known to run on all versions of Windows from
Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 through to Vista.  The Windows port is
built using the Win32 API and supports most features of the X version,
including variable width fonts, images and tooltips.

</p><h3 class="section">1.3 What other versions of Emacs run on Windows?</h3>

<p><a name="index-other-ports-of-Emacs-5"></a>

</p><h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 MSDOS and Windows 3.11</h4>

<p><a name="index-DOS-port-6"></a><a name="index-Windows-3_002e11-port-7"></a>
<a href="mailto:eliz@gnu.org">Eli Zaretskii</a> maintains the port of GNU Emacs
for DOS and 16 bit Windows.  When run on Windows 95, 98 and ME, it
will support long file names, and uses the Windows clipboard on all
versions of Windows.  The latest pre-compiled version at
<a href="ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djpp/current/v2gnu/">ftp.delorie.com</a>
seems to be 20.5, but more recent versions can be built from source
using DJGPP.

</p><h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 Meadow</h4>

<p><a name="index-Meadow-8"></a>
<a href="mailto:hisashi.miyashita@xemacs.org">Hisashi Miyashita</a> created
Meadow the early days of Emacs 20, when the Windows port was far behind in
supporting the new multilingual functionality.  Meadow continues to be
developed along with Emacs due to some extra functionality that it
offers, particularly for Japanese users.  Information in English is
available from the
<a href="http://www.meadowy.org/meadow/pukiwiki-en/">Meadow Wiki</a>.

</p><h4 class="subsection">1.3.3 EmacsW32</h4>

<p><a name="index-EmacsW32-9"></a>
<a href="mailto:lennart.borgman@gmail.com">Lennart Borgman</a> maintains some
patches which he calls
<a href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html">EmacsW32</a>.  His
patches aim to provide closer integration with Windows, and make
things easier for Windows refugees to begin the transition to Emacs. 
Lennart is active in Emacs development, so some of his patches are
likely to be included in future versions of Emacs.  In addition to
the patches themselves, Lennart also offers installers for development
versions of Emacs from CVS, both with and without his patches.

</p><h4 class="subsection">1.3.4 XEmacs</h4>

<p><a name="index-XEmacs-10"></a>
XEmacs has also been ported to Windows.  See the
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/faq/xemacs-faq.html#SEC254">XEmacs FAQ</a>.

</p><h4 class="subsection">1.3.5 Other distributions</h4>

<p>There are a number of others who distribute Windows binaries of
Emacs, either bundled with some extra lisp libraries for a particular
purpose, or development code from CVS packaged as an installer.  Because
these come and go (mostly during long development cycles without
an official release), they are not listed here.
