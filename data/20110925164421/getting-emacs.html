     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs on MS
     Windows with answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other
     languages, transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info,
     WWW), and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

</p><h3 class="section">2.1 Where can I get pre-compiled versions?</h3>

<p><a name="index-precompiled-binaries-11"></a><a name="index-where-to-get-Emacs-binaries-12"></a>
Pre-compiled versions are distributed from
<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/">ftp.gnu.org</a> and its
mirrors<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Emacs binaries are distributed as zip files, digitally
signed by the developer who built them.  Generally most users will
want the file <samp><span class="file">emacs-23.3-bin-i386.zip</span></samp>, which
contains everything you need to get started.  The file
<samp><span class="file">emacs-23.3-barebin-i386.zip</span></samp> is provided for users
who already have the source, but had second thoughts about compiling
it themselves.

</p><h3 class="section">2.2 Where can I get the source distribution?</h3>

<p><a name="index-where-to-get-sources-13"></a><a name="index-Emacs-source-code-14"></a><a name="index-source-for-Emacs-15"></a>
The latest source is always available from
<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/">ftp.gnu.org</a> and its mirrors. 
It is distributed as a gzipped tar file, digitally signed by the maintainer
who made the release.  For minor releases, xdeltas for patching the previous
release are also available.

</p><h3 class="section">2.3 Can I get the source from CVS?</h3>

<p><a name="index-CVS_002c-getting-Emacs-16"></a><a name="index-latest-development-version-of-Emacs-17"></a><a name="index-Emacs-Development-18"></a>
Yes you can.  See the instructions on
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs">Savannah</a>, the GNU
development site, for details.

</p><h3 class="section">2.4 How can I compile Emacs myself?</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiling-Emacs-19"></a>
To compile Emacs on Windows, you will need the MingW or Cygwin port of
GCC with MingW make, or a Microsoft C compiler with nmake and the
single threaded C runtime library.  Recent versions of Microsoft
Visual Studio no longer come with the single threaded C runtime
library, which is required for certain POSIX compatibility, so MingW
is usually the best choice.  Image support requires external
libraries, the headers and import libraries for which will need to be
installed where your compiler can find them.  You will also need ports
of GNU <samp><span class="command">rm</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">cp</span></samp>, as the Windows native
equivalents are not consistent between versions.  GNU texinfo will be
required to build the manuals.  See <a indepth="true" href="other-useful-ports.html#Other-useful-ports">Other useful ports</a>.

   </p><p>After unpacking the source, or checking out of CVS, be sure to read the
instructions in <samp><span class="file">nt/README</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">nt/INSTALL</span></samp>.

</p><h3 class="section">2.5 How do I use a debugger on Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-debugging-Emacs-20"></a><a name="index-bugs-in-Emacs_002c-how-to-debug-21"></a><a name="index-Emacs-debugging-22"></a>
By default, Emacs is compiled with debugging on, and optimizations enabled. 
The optimizations may interfere with some types of debugging; the debugger
may not show clearly where it is, or may not be able to inspect certain
variables.  If this is the case, reconfigure with <samp><span class="option">--no-opt</span></samp>.

   </p><p>The file <samp><span class="file">etc/DEBUG</span></samp> contains general debugging hints, as well as
specific notes about debugging Emacs with both gdb and Microsoft debuggers.

</p><h4 class="subsection">2.5.1 GDB</h4>

<p><a name="index-GDB_002c-debugging-Emacs-with-23"></a><a name="index-debugging-Emacs-with-GDB-24"></a>
GDB is the GNU debugger, which can be used to debug Emacs when it has
been compiled with GCC.  The best results will be obtained if you
start gdb from the <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp> directory as ‘<samp><span class="samp">gdb oo/i386/emacs.exe</span></samp>’. 
This will load the init file <samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp> in that directory, to
define some extra commands for working with lisp while debugging, and
set up breakpoints to catch abnormal aborts.

</p><h4 class="subsection">2.5.2 Microsoft Developer Studio</h4>

<p><a name="index-MSVC_002b_002b_002c-debugging-Emacs-with-25"></a><a name="index-DevStudio_002c-debugging-Emacs-with-26"></a><a name="index-debugging-Emacs-with-MS-DevStudio-27"></a>
MS DevStudio can be used to debug Emacs when it has been compiled with
a Microsoft compiler.  To view lisp variables, you can call the
function <code>debug_print</code> from the Quickwatch window.  Some
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/debug.txt">old tips</a> are probably still valid.
