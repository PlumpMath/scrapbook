    <h1>Top 10 reasons to use ack for source code</h1>

    <h2>1. It's fast</h2>

    <p>
    Ack only searches the stuff that makes sense to search.  Perl's
    regular expressions are highly optimized.
    </p>

    <h2>2. It's portable</h2>

    <p>
    ack is pure Perl, so it runs on Windows just fine. It has no
    dependencies other than Perl 5. <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/install/">Installation is a snap</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. It ignores VCS directories</h2>

    <p>
    ack searches recursively by default, while ignoring <code>.git</code>,
    <code>.svn</code>, <code>CVS</code> and other VCS directories.
    </p>

    <blockquote><code>
            # Which would you rather type?<br>
            $ grep pattern $(find . -type f | grep -v '\.svn')<br>
            <br>
            $ ack pattern</code></blockquote>

    <h2>4. Better search results</h2>

    <p>
    Since ack defaults to only searching source code, you get fewer false positives.
    </p><ul>
        <li>VCS directories
        </li><li><i>blib</i>, the Perl build directory
        </li><li>backup files like <i>foo~</i> and <i>#foo#</i>
        </li><li>binary files, core dumps, etc
    </li></ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2>5. Easy filetype specifications</h2>

    <p>
    If you have a big project with many different languages combined, it's easy to add
    <tt>--perl</tt> to search only Perl files, or use <tt>--nohtml</tt> to search everything except HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
    ack's filetype detection means more than just specifying a single file extension.
    </p>

    <blockquote><code>
            # Which would you rather type?
            $ grep pattern $(find . -name '*.pl' -or -name '*.pm' -or  -name '*.pod' | grep -v .svn)<br>
            <br>
            $ ack --perl pattern
    </code></blockquote>

    <p>
    Plus, ack does filetype detection that <code>find</code> can't.
    ack checks the shebang lines of scripts without extensions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Creates lists of files without searching</h2>

    <p>
    Since ack can know to search only, say, Ruby files with the
    <code>--ruby</code> switch, you can also generate a list of
    files in a tree with the <code>-f</code> switch.
    </p>

    <blockquote><code>
            # List all Ruby files in the tree<br>
            $ ack -f --ruby &gt; all-ruby-files
    </code></blockquote>

    <h2>7. Match highlighting</h2>

    <p>
    ack has flexible match highlighting, where you can specify the
    colors to use in its output.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Perl regular expressions</h2>

    <p>
    Perl leads the programming world with its regular expressions.
    ack uses Perl's regular expressions, not a "Perl-compatible"
    subset.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can also take advantage of Perl's match variables.  For
    example, to generate a list of all files <code>#include</code>d
    in your C code, use this:
    </p>

    <blockquote><code>
            ack --cc '#include\s+&lt;(.*)&gt;' --output '$1' -h
    </code></blockquote>


    <h2>9. Command switches much like GNU grep</h2>

    <p>
    If you know GNU grep, you know most of ack's switches, too.
    Word-only searching with <code>-w</code>, case-insensitive
    searching with <code>-i</code>, etc
    </p>

    <h2>10. "ack" is shorter than "grep" to type</h2>

    <p>
    This one is sort of a joke, but sort of not.  You spend hours
    every day searching through source code.  ack makes it as quick
    and easy as possible to do that searching and to remove as much
    drudgerous typing as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
    Defaults matter.  The less typing you have to do, the better.
    </p>

    "Every once in a while something comes along that improves an idea so much,
    you can't ignore it. Such a thing is Ack, the grep replacement."
    -- <a href="http://www.unixlore.net/use-ack-as-better-grep.html">unixlore.net</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "Whoa, this is *so* much better than grep it's not even funny."
    -- <a href="http://jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, creator of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    "Thanks for creating ack and sharing it with the world.  It
    makes my days just a little more pleasant.  I'm glad to have
    it in my toolbox.  That <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/install/">installation is as simple
    as downloading the standalone version</a> and chmodding
    is a nice touch."
    -- <a href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/">Alan De Smet</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "I came across ack today, and now grep is sleeping outside. It's very
    much like grep, except it assumes all the little things that you always
    wanted grep to remember, but that it never did. It actually left the
    light on for you, and put the toilet seat down."
    -- <a href="http://assistedsilicon.blogspot.com/2008/09/ack-grep-but-better.html">Samuel Huckins</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "ack is the best tool I have added to my toolbox in the past year, hands down."
    -- <a href="http://billmill.org/">Bill Mill</a> on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/info/6odl4/comments/">reddit</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "I use it all the time and I can't imagine how I managed with only
    grep."
    -- <a href="http://marnanel.org/">Thomas Thurman</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "This has been replacing a Rube Goldberg mess of <tt>find/grep/xargs</tt>
    that I've been using to search source files in a fairly large codebase."
    -- <a href="http://www.anomaly.org/wade/">G. Wade Johnson</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "You had me at <tt>--thpppt</tt>."
    -- John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/november#tue-27-ack">Daring Fireball</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "Grepping of SVN repositories was driving me crazy until I found ack. It
    fixes all of my grep annoyances and adds features I didn't even know I
    wanted." -- <a href="http://www.prescod.net/">Paul Prescod</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "I added ack standalone to our internal devtools project at work. People
    are all over it." -- <a href="http://www.multiply.org/">Jason Gessner</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "I just wanted to send you my praise for this wonderful little
    application.  It's in my toolbox now and after one day of use has proven
    itself invaluable." -- <a href="http://www.just-another.net/">Benjamin W. Smith</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "ack has replaced grep for me for 90% of what I used it for.
    Obsoleted most of my 'grep is crippled' wrapper scripts, too."
    -- Randall Hansen
    </p>

    <p>
    "ack's powerful search facilities are an invaluable tool for searching
    large repositories like <a href="http://parrot.org/">Parrot</a>. The
    ability to control the search domain by filetype--and to do so
    independent of platform--has made one-liners out of many complex
    queries previously done with custom scripts. Parrot developers
    are hooked on ack."
    -- <a href="http://www.rakudoconsulting.com/">Jerry Gay</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    "That thing is awesome. People see me using it and ask what the heck it is."
    -- Andrew Moore

    <p>
    "ack is certainly one of those simple pleasures of life on the command line."
